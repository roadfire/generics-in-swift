# Working with Generics in Swift

Swift has support for generics, and if you're going to use Swift effectively, you need to be able to *read* generics at the very least. And if you want to be really good at Swift, you should be able to *write* code with generics. So let's get on with making you a really good Swift developer...

## Two ways you can learn about generics in Swift

1. (**Recommended**) Read [the article](http://roadfiresoftware.com/2014/07/working-with-generics-in-swift/) behind this and follow along, writing the code in your own Playground. Come back here for the Playground if you get stuck.
2. Clone this repo, open the Playground, and read through the comments while you tweak and play.
